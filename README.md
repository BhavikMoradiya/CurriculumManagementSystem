Group Project for Personal Software Process Fall 2015. Site originally created by Hussain Almaleki.
Updated using SCRUM process with three sprints completed.

This site uses php as its backend language and is set to use mysql for its database needs. 
An Sql file to create needed databases and populate with test data exists in 
sql/cms_database_with_data_updated.sql. Edit the includes/ files to meet your database needs.

Documentation of changes during our involvement with the site can be found in the documentation folder. 
This includes product and sprint backlogs as well as test cases.
